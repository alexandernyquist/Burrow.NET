- Fix method SetSerializer on RabbitTunnel to make serializer change to all dependencies
- Implement Burrow.RPC
- Fix a bug that execute the subscriptions twice when the connection to server has been establised before when a new tunnel want to publish a new message.

- Change the PreFetchSize data type to uint which enventually let the app prefetch everything in the queue if the size is larger than ushort.MaxValue
